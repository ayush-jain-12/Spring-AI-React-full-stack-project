## Project Title: Ask AI - An AI-Powered Chatbot, Photo Generator, and Recipe Generator

# Project Description:

Ask AI is a comprehensive AI-driven platform developed using Spring Boot for the backend and React for the frontend. This full-stack project leverages the power of the OpenAI API to deliver three core functionalities:

# AI Chatbot:
The chatbot provides a natural language interface where users can ask questions, seek advice, or have casual conversations. The chatbot is designed to handle various topics and provides intelligent, context-aware responses. It's built using the OpenAI GPT model, allowing for a highly interactive and engaging user experience.

# Photo Generator:
This feature allows users to generate images based on textual descriptions. Users can describe a scene, object, or any imaginative concept, and the AI will create a visual representation of it. The backend handles requests to the OpenAI image generation API, processes the results, and delivers the generated images to the frontend for display.

# Recipe Generator:
The recipe generator helps users create new and unique recipes based on the ingredients they have or the type of dish they wish to prepare. By entering a list of ingredients or a desired cuisine along with specific dietary restrictions, the AI suggests recipes, complete with instructions and nutritional information. This feature also uses the OpenAI API to generate creative and practical culinary ideas.
